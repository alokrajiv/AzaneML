FORK OF AZANE IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A SIMPLE WEB BASED TO REACH THE ML PROGRAM.

# AzaneML
Azane is a Machine Learning Engine for predictive analysis of application logs.
# Weka
This engine has been created in sync with *.jar shipped by WEKA. Please make sure to add the correct reference as mentioned within the code.
# arff
Please create your training and test data in the *.arff format and change the location path within the engine code.
# Why Azane ?
We have seen many engines detecting patterns right at the network/OS level. However, when we thought of BYOD, we wanted an engine to detect user behaviour / application behaviour patterns right at the application level.
Thus we thought to create this engine which will integrate in a very simple manner within any applications developed. This will help to maintain User Privacy and organizations can make sure their data is protected from illegal access
# Version
0.1 -> Creation of the engine with NB Algorithm. Ready for integration.
